SELECT student_id FROM enrollments
UNION
SELECT student_id FROM grades;

2. Get all instructor and student names
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM instructors;

3. Get all distinct majors from students and departments

7. Get distinct course names from courses and enrollments
SELECT course_name FROM courses
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT c.course_name FROM enrollments e
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;

8. Get all student IDs and instructor IDs (avoiding duplicates)
SELECT student_id FROM students

SELECT student_id FROM enrollments
UNION ALL
SELECT student_id FROM grades;

10. Get all instructors and students in descending order
SELECT first_name FROM instructors
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name FROM students
ORDER BY first_name DESC;


```

## INTERSECT returns only the common records between two queries.

```sql

1. Find student IDs that exist in both enrollments and grades
SELECT student_id FROM enrollments
INTERSECT
SELECT student_id FROM grades;

2. Find common first names between students and instructors
SELECT first_name FROM students
INTERSECT
SELECT first_name FROM instructors;

3. Find common course IDs between enrollments and grades
SELECT course_id FROM enrollments
INTERSECT
SELECT course_id FROM grades;

4. Find students who are also instructors
SELECT student_id FROM students
INTERSECT
SELECT instructor_id FROM instructors;

5. Find common emails between students and instructors
SELECT email FROM students
INTERSECT
SELECT email FROM instructors;

6. Find courses that are both assigned to instructors and have enrollments
SELECT course_id FROM course_instructors
INTERSECT
SELECT course_id FROM enrollments;

7. Find students enrolled in the same courses they received grades for
SELECT student_id, course_id FROM enrollments
INTERSECT
SELECT student_id, course_id FROM grades;

8. Find instructors who are also students
SELECT first_name FROM students
INTERSECT
SELECT first_name FROM instructors;

9. Find courses with the same name in both the courses table and enrollments
SELECT course_name FROM courses
INTERSECT
SELECT DISTINCT c.course_name FROM enrollments e
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;

10. Find students who have the same last name as instructors
SELECT last_name FROM students
INTERSECT
SELECT last_name FROM instructors;


```


## EXCEPT returns records from the first query that do not exist in the second query.

```sql

1. Find students who are enrolled but donâ€™t have grades
SELECT student_id FROM enrollments
EXCEPT
SELECT student_id FROM grades;

2. Find students who are not also instructors
SELECT student_id FROM students
EXCEPT
SELECT instructor_id FROM instructors;

3. Find instructors who have not been assigned to any courses
